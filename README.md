# Annotation Codebase

This contains the codebase for the different annotation experiements:

1. Image Annotation: This is used to verify that the Images being used have a similar credibility
2. Project Annotation: This is used to help pick a more neutral project by A/B testing two synthetic projects.

More information about each of these is provided by the ReadMe.md files in the corresponding folders
