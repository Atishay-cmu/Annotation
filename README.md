# Image Annotation Project

This repository contains the codebase for a streamlit app that is hosted on AWS. 

This repository is part of a bigger project that aims to understand effect of race and gender on crowdfunding platforms.

---------------------------------------------

* The bulk of the code is present in ```test.py``` as it contains all the streamlit API code.

* The ```style.css``` only contains stylistic code and it non-essential. 

* ```b-f``` : The folder contains eight generated images of black females

* ```b-m``` : The folder contains eight generated images of black males

* ```w-f``` : The folder contains eight generated images of white females

* ```w-m``` : The folder contains eight generated images of white males

* ```results```: This folder contains the annotated data about the photos. 

* ```analysis.py```: It is just a wrapper code to collect and clean all the annotated data. (this is not the final version of this file)
